					<p>Every kind of product were available in the market. So that everyone buy it and use,
						But there is a tragedy while using these suppose if we have a cradle and after 2
						years the cradle is good in condition to use. But there is no
						child in the home to use the same. On the same time that the home needs a chair to
						sit that child and have no efficient money to buy that chair. On the other hand there
						is an user who have no money to buy a cradle but he have
						a chair to sold or excess for his house. Currently no scenario available to buy or
						sell these products</p>
					<p>In these circumstances we can buy or sell a product with cashless technology called
						<b>‘TIT-TAT’</b>. Here the user can update his/her account with a product he/she have
						and the he can demand a product what he/she need. If another
						user came here with different product but match with the product demanded by the
						first customer based on credits then if the second customer request the product and
						the first customer like to buy second customer product with
						in a day then they can exchange their product and use the products. The products were
						verified by an external verifier.
